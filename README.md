# AMATH482-Computational-Methods-Data-Analysis
Reports created by me for AMATH 482: Computational Methods for Data Analysis at the University of Washington (Winter 2022)

Each homework folder contains a word document for the assignment report as well as Python notebooks used to compute the results and create the visualizations present in
the report.
